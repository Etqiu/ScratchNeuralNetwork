# Making A Neural Network From Scratch:

**Goal**: To implement a neural network using only numPy that has two hidden layers and one output layer with two activation functions. We can then train our neural network on the MNIST data-set, and test it to see our accuracy. 

Currently working on the kaggle notebook (.ipynb file), but will eventually try running it locally.
